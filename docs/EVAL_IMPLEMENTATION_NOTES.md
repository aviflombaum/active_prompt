# Evaluation Implementation Notes

## Summary of Implementation

The evaluation feature for ActivePrompt has been successfully implemented with the following components:

### 1. Backend Implementation ✓

#### Models Created
- `ActivePrompt::EvalSet` - Manages evaluation sets for prompts
- `ActivePrompt::TestCase` - Individual test cases with input/output pairs
- `ActivePrompt::EvalRun` - Tracks evaluation runs and results
- `ActivePrompt::EvalResult` - Individual test results (for future use)

#### Services & Clients
- `ActivePrompt::EvaluationRunner` - Orchestrates evaluation execution
- `ActivePrompt::OpenAIEvalsClient` - Handles OpenAI Evals API communication with proper error handling

#### Controllers
- `EvalSetsController` - Full CRUD operations + run action
- `TestCasesController` - CRUD operations for test cases
- `EvalRunsController` - View evaluation results

### 2. Error Handling ✓
- Comprehensive error handling for API failures
- Specific handling for:
  - Authentication errors
  - Rate limiting
  - General API errors
  - Timeouts
- User-friendly error messages in the UI

### 3. Testing ✓
- Request specs for all controllers
- Integration tests for complete workflow
- System tests for UI interactions
- Live API test suite (optional, requires credentials)
- Test factories for all eval models

### 4. Seed Data ✓
- Added comprehensive eval seed data to `spec/dummy/db/seeds.rb`
- Includes sample eval sets, test cases, and completed runs

### 5. Documentation ✓
- API credentials setup guide in `docs/API_CREDENTIALS.md`
- Updated README with API configuration instructions
- Demo rake task: `rake active_prompt:eval_demo`

## Known Issues

### Test Environment Autoloading
There's an issue with Rails autoloading the `OpenAIEvalsClient` in the test environment. The application works correctly in development, but some request specs fail with:
```
NameError: uninitialized constant ActivePrompt::OpenAIEvalsClient
```

**Workaround**: The engine.rb file has been updated to include the clients directory in autoload paths, but may require a server restart.

### OpenAI Evals API Availability
The OpenAI Evals API is not available on all OpenAI accounts. The implementation includes:
- Graceful fallback for accounts without access
- Mock evaluation option for testing
- Alternative approach using standard chat completions

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Demo
```bash
cd spec/dummy
bundle exec rake active_prompt:eval_demo
```

### Configuring API Keys
```bash
rails credentials:edit
```

Add:
```yaml
openai:
  api_key: sk-your-api-key-here
```

### Complete Workflow
1. Create a prompt with variables (e.g., `{{topic}}`)
2. Navigate to the prompt and click "Evaluations"
3. Create an evaluation set
4. Add test cases with input variables and expected outputs
5. Click "Run Evaluation"
6. View results (aggregate counts from OpenAI)

### Running Tests
```bash
# All eval-related tests
bundle exec rspec spec/requests/active_prompt/eval*_spec.rb
bundle exec rspec spec/integration/eval_workflow_spec.rb
bundle exec rspec spec/system/eval_workflow_spec.rb

# Live API tests (requires credentials)
LIVE_API_TESTS=true bundle exec rspec spec/services/active_prompt/evaluation_runner_live_spec.rb
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Individual Test Results**: Currently only aggregate counts are shown. Individual results could be fetched from OpenAI.
2. **More Grader Types**: Beyond exact match (regex, contains, LLM judge)
3. **Batch Operations**: Import/export test cases
4. **Comparison Views**: Compare results across runs
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Webhook support for automated testing

## Technical Notes

- The implementation follows the OpenAI Evals API specification
- Uses synchronous polling with 5-second intervals (max 5 minutes)
- File uploads use multipart form data
- All API errors are properly handled and logged
- The UI auto-refreshes for running evaluations
