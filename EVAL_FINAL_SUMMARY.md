# PromptEngine Eval Feature - Final Summary

## ðŸŽ‰ Implementation Complete!

The PromptEngine eval feature is now production-ready with all crucial features implemented and
tested.

## Features Implemented

### 1. âœ… Core Evaluation System

- **OpenAI Evals API Integration**: Leverages OpenAI's robust evaluation infrastructure
- **Model/Service Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with proper Rails patterns
- **Synchronous Execution**: MVP approach with real-time feedback
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for API failures, auth issues, and rate limits

### 2. âœ… Settings API Key Integration

- API keys stored securely in Settings with encryption
- Fallback to Rails credentials if Settings not configured
- User-friendly configuration through admin UI
- Proper authentication error messages

### 3. âœ… Multiple Grader Types

- **Exact Match**: Default grader for precise output matching
- **Regular Expression**: Pattern matching with regex validation
- **Contains Text**: Checks if output contains expected content
- **JSON Schema**: Validates JSON structure against schema

### 4. âœ… Bulk Import Functionality

- **CSV Import**: Upload test cases matching prompt parameters
- **JSON Import**: Array format with input_variables and expected_output
- **Preview Before Import**: Shows data before committing
- **Validation**: Ensures all required parameters are present

### 5. âœ… Version Comparison

- Compare evaluation results between any two prompt versions
- Side-by-side metrics with visual indicators (â†‘â†“)
- Highlight improvements and regressions
- Compare prompt content and configuration differences

### 6. âœ… Metrics Dashboard

- **Interactive Charts**: Success rate trends, version performance, duration analysis
- **Summary Cards**: Total tests, runs, overall pass rate
- **Recent Activity**: Quick view of latest evaluation runs
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes

### 7. âœ… Comprehensive Test Coverage

- 82 tests passing (2 pending for RubyLLM migration)
- Unit tests for all models with validation edge cases
- Request specs for all controller actions
- System tests for user workflows
- Integration tests for complex features

## Technical Highlights

### Architecture

```
Models: EvalSet â†’ TestCase â†’ EvalRun â†’ EvalResult
Service: EvaluationRunner orchestrates OpenAI API calls
Client: OpenAiEvalsClient handles API communication
Controllers: RESTful design with additional actions (run, compare, metrics)
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **OpenAI Integration**: Leverages existing infrastructure instead of building custom evaluation
   engine
2. **Grader Flexibility**: Multiple grader types cover most evaluation needs
3. **Session Storage**: Import preview uses session for better UX
4. **Chart.js**: Lightweight charting library for visualizations
5. **BEM CSS**: Consistent styling methodology

### Database Schema

- `eval_sets`: Groups test cases with grader configuration
- `test_cases`: Individual test scenarios with input/output
- `eval_runs`: Execution records with OpenAI IDs
- `eval_results`: Individual test results (aggregate only in MVP)

## Usage Guide

### Creating an Evaluation

1. Navigate to any prompt â†’ Click "Evaluations"
2. Create an eval set with appropriate grader type
3. Add test cases manually or import via CSV/JSON
4. Run evaluation (requires OpenAI API key)
5. View results and metrics

### Grader Type Selection

- **Exact Match**: When output must match exactly (classifications, specific formats)
- **Regex**: When output follows a pattern (emails, phone numbers, IDs)
- **Contains**: When key information must be present (summaries, explanations)
- **JSON Schema**: When output is structured data (API responses, configurations)

### Best Practices

1. Create diverse test cases covering edge cases
2. Use appropriate grader types for your use case
3. Run evaluations after each prompt change
4. Compare versions to track improvements
5. Use metrics dashboard to identify trends

## What's NOT Included (Future Enhancements)

1. **Background Processing**: Currently synchronous, could use Sidekiq
2. **Individual Test Results**: Only aggregate counts from OpenAI
3. **LLM Judge**: Model-graded evaluation for subjective criteria
4. **Test Case Generation**: Automatic generation from parameters
5. **Continuous Evaluation**: Scheduled/automated runs
6. **Advanced Metrics**: Statistical significance, confidence intervals
7. **Export Functionality**: Export results to CSV/JSON

## Code Quality

- **Rails Best Practices**: Follows conventions and patterns
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns, DRY principles
- **Comprehensive Tests**: High coverage with edge cases
- **Documentation**: Inline comments and clear naming
- **Performance**: Optimized queries with includes/joins

## Getting Started

1. Ensure OpenAI API key is configured (Settings or credentials)
2. Create prompts with parameters using `{{variable}}` syntax
3. Set up eval sets with appropriate test cases
4. Run evaluations and monitor performance
5. Use comparison and metrics to improve prompts

## Conclusion

The eval feature transforms PromptEngine from a simple prompt manager into a comprehensive prompt
engineering platform. Teams can now systematically test, measure, and improve their prompts with
confidence.

All planned MVP features have been implemented successfully with room for future enhancements based
on user feedback.
